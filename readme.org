* Introduction
Parsing =.kra= files.
For now, =kra-file= only parses the metadata of a file.
The goal is to allow loading the files or creating them from scratch, and modifying them (updating node data, inserting and removing nodes, updating metadata)
The project will be implemented in two crates, one providing core library functionality, another - file access.
** Features
*** Parse meta
+ File metadata
+ Layer metadata
  Does not parse ~selected="true"~ property, which indicates the layer that should be selected when loading the file.
** Tasks
*** CURRENT Decode raster data
This will be done in =kra= crate.
*** NEXT Process raster layers
In =kra-file=.
+ Decode
+ Encode
*** NEXT Create a ~.kra~ file
+ Roundtrip a file
+ Create a file from scratch
