* Introduction
Parsing =.kra= files.
For now, =kra-file= only parses the metadata of a file.
The goal is to allow loading the files or creating them from scratch, and editing them.
The project will be later implemented in two crates, one providing core library functionality, another - file access.
** Features
*** Parse meta
